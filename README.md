## Known Differences from Prototype:

-**Films Page:** The review process exists with progress indication and confirmation, but the ability to save draft reviews as in the prototype is not implemented; this proved to be more than we could manage within the project timeline.

-**Search Bar in Navigation:** In the prototype, the search bar was originally designed in its current location. After user testing, we moved it to the navigation bar, but implementing it there proved too difficult. We reverted it to its original location and added an Explore button on the home page to provide additional guidance for users. This design keeps the search bar consistent with the friends page.

-**Comment on Reviews:** Commenting on reviews was in the prototype, but adding a full commenting system was too complex to implement within the timeline.
